#Program Purpose: A multiple exceptions example:
                            #A. ZeroDivisionError:, B ValueError: C Default

#$$$$Beginning of computations$$$$$$$

total_storage = 100

#What the program will 'try' unless an error occurs              
try:
    number_projects = int(input("How many projects are you housing on your cpu? "))
    storage_split = total_storage /  number_projects
    print("Equally split they're each reserved:",storage_split)

 #If a someone tries to divide by zero    
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("0 projects?! What shall we build?")

#For example if the user enters a string instead of a number
except ValueError:
    print("Numbers only.Perhaps you spelled the number?"

#Default exception * has to be last in your exception branches!
except:
    print("Sorry only digits")
