#Asking the user for a number to test
number_to_test = int (input ("Please enter a int to test whether it is even or odd: "))

#The even/odd determiner: if there will be a remainder if the number was divided by 2
if (number_to_test % 2) == 0: 

              print (number_to_test, " is even")

else:

              print (number_to_test, " is odd")
