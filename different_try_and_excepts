#_________________Beginning of script_________________

#Developer Name: Akinwale "Wally" Owi
#Program Purpose: A few 'try and except' techniques

#________________Beginning of computations________________

#What the program will 'try' unless an error occurs              
try:
    number_jersey = int(input("Please enter your preferred jersey number: "))
    print("Then number:",number_jersey, "you shall be")

except AttributeError:
    print("Sorry AttributeError,")
#AttributeErrors would be rare in this situation becuse they can occur when we:
#mispell variable names or try to utilize variables in ways they do not support, like trying to use the append function on an int.
    

except ValueError:
    print("Sorry ValueError,we like '2' over 'two'")
#ValueErrors can happen when the input user enters is not the desired variable type


except:
    print("Sorry try something like '7'")
#set to run when the error doesnt fall under any planned excepts like above
