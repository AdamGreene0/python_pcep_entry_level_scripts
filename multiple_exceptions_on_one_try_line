    #normally would stop cxs from entering a number below 0 and/or above the items offered number
    print( desired_dessert_num,"?, Great choice")

except (AttributeError,TypeError, ValueError) as error:

     print(error)
    #AttributeErrors would be rare in this situation becuse they can occur when we:
    #~mispell variable names or try to utilize variables in ways they do not support, like trying to use the append function on an int
    
    #TypeError - most likelly here it occurs when someone tries to enter the wrong type of data into a variable
    
    #ValueErrors can happen when the operation applied to the variable is correct but the input is not desired variable type
