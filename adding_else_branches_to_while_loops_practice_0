#Program Purpose: Adding else branches to while loops when we want them to run after the while condition is broken.


#~~When the while loop's condtions are met at least once/runs once example
a = 1
while a < 6:
     
    print("Inside of the while, a value currently =", a)
    a += 2
    print() #Just a space to increase readability 
    
else:
    print("While 'a' broken:")
    print("1.Prints when the loop reaches its end, break a value =", a)
    #Just a space to increase readability 

#~~When the while loop's condtions are never met/ never runs example
 
b = 30
while b < 4:
    print("Inside of the while, b value currently =", b)
    b += 5
    print() #Just a space to increase readability 
    
else:
    print()#Just a space to increase readability
    print("While 'b' broken:")
    print("2.Also prints because b still breaks the while , b is still=", b)
