#Program Purpose: Adding else branches to while loop's to get a guranteed run


#~~When the while loop's condtions are met at least once/runs once example
a = 1
while a < 15:
     
    print("Inside of the while, a value currently =", a)
    a += 5
    print() #Just a space to increase readability 
    
else:
    print("prints regardless, a is now =  ", a)
    #Just a space to increase readability 

#~~When the while loop's condtions are never met/ never runs example
 
b = 10
while b < 3:
    print("Inside of the while, b value currently =", b)
    b += 5
    print() #Just a space to increase readability 
    
else:
    print()#Just a space to increase readability 
    print("prints regardless, b is now =  ", b)
