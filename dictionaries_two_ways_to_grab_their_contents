#Program Purpose: Two ways to grab a dictionary's keys and values: 1 Items fx, 2 values fx

#$$$$Beginning of computations$$$$$$$

#Creating a number to string dictionary
employee_ids = {
     5555: 'Claire',
    777: 'Wally',
    222: 'Rissa'
}

#The items function, itemizes both but does not sort
for ids,employees in employee_ids.items():
    print ( "Employee = ", employees , ",their id = ", ids) #Outputs Employee =  Claire ,their id =  5555
    #                                                                                         Employee =  Wally ,their id =  777
#                                                                                             Employee =  Rissa ,their id =  222        

#Spacing
print("___")

#Using the values fx
for employee_names in employee_ids.values():
    print (employee_names) #outputs: Claire
                                        #            Wally
                                        #            Rissa
