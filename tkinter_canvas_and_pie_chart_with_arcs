location_and_size = 1, 18, 200, 200
#(leftmost spot with bigger numbers pushing it to the right ,zenith with bigger being lower on the canvas,width,height)

arc = myCanvas.create_arc(location_and_size , start=0, extent=240, fill="yellow")
#start is starting spot/angle, c extent is what percent filled out of 359(99.9%) because 360 cause a flat line, d. filll is our color choice
