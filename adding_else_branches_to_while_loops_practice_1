#Program Purpose: Adding else branches to while loops when we want them to run after the while condition is broken.
#practice 1


#~~When the while loop's condtions are met at least once/runs once example
on_shelf_apples = 0
while on_shelf_apples  < 20 :
     
    print("Inside of the while, there are currently:", on_shelf_apples, "apples on the shelf")
    
    #increment 
    on_shelf_apples += 8
    print() #Just a space to increase readability 
    
else:
    print("Loop 1. Stocked! While 'on_shelf_apples ' broke:")
    print("Prints when the loop reaches its end, break on_shelf_apples  value =", on_shelf_apples )
    #Just a space to increase readability 

#~~When the while loop's condtions are never met/ never runs example
 
broccoli_on_shelf = 20
while broccoli_on_shelf  < 20:
    print("Inside of the while, broccoli_on_shelf value currently =", broccoli_on_shelf)

    #increment 
    broccoli_on_shelf += 5
    print() #Just a space to increase readability 
    
else:
    print()#Just a space to increase readability
    print("Loop 2. Stocked! While 'broccoli_on_shelf ' has broke:")
    print("Also prints because broccoli_on_shelf still breaks the while , broccoli_on_shelf  is still=", broccoli_on_shelf)
