#Absolute beginning of script

#Developer: Akin "Wally" Owi
#Program purpose:Temporarily cloak numbers as strings so we can concatenate them into/onto print statements

num_hotels = 4 #The number will we be printing as a string

#Just the num
print(num_hotels)

#Printing a string plus a unformatted number will normally create an error.So the line is commented out
#print("How many hotels will we visit this year?" + num_hotels)


#*Printing the number as a string
print("How many hotels will we visit this year? " + str(num_hotels)) #It is the str()
print(str(num_hotels)+ "")

#Doing a calculation on it to check that it is still truly a number
num_hotels = num_hotels +1

print(num_hotels)#Printing out the new number
